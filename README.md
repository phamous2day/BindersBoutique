##First MVP
Carousel edition go here: https://phamous2day.github.io/BindersBoutique/indexCarousel.html
I realized with this version it was comparable with a full-fledged website. As cool as the carousel was, I had feedback on how it was a little too "gimicky" and didn't really emphasis that this was a lesser microsite to supplement the parent website rather than act as its rival.
